######## Write the pseudocode in comments for task 2 here
# As the robot moves to the material of the item, the paper is recycled into the wood bin, plastic in plastic bin, and aluminium in metal bin.

######## Write the pseudocode in comments for task 3 here
# The robot has to investigate the code "B ueno celeste ka mustavatufa"
# If the code user put is "B ueno celeste ka mustavatufa", then let him enter the house. Otherwise, lock it.
# Except Gregory.

# Pseudocode 4

# As the robot checks students scoring, you calculate the test score.
# Compute the test score for test 1 = 0.2 x test score
# Compute the test score for test 2 = 0.4 x test score
# Compute the test score for test 3 = 0.4 x test score

# Real code task 4
